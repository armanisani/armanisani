       <p> Tap water is a healthier option than soft drinks. But according to the Environmental Working Group, there have been 315 pollutants found in America's tap water since 2004, and over half of these pollutants are completely unregulated and can legally exist in any amount</p>
       <p>At the current levels of contamination, the public is starting to question the quality of tap water and wonders if it is safe enough to drink. Based on these facts, it's no wonder that the demand for Kangen Water® is constantly increasing.</p>

        <p>Bottled water is not necessarily healthier than tap water and yet it costs much more! Although associated with healthy water, bottled water is not guaranteed to be any healthier than tap water. Often the only difference is the added minerals which have no proven health benefits.</p>
        <p>A four-year study by the Natural Resources Defense Council shows that 1/3 of the bottled water tested contains levels of contamination which exceed allowable limits. Bottled water can also be slightly acidic, which may affect your body's pH balance. Finally, the environmental impact caused by the production and disposal of plastic bottles is harmful to our ecosystem.</p>

        <p>Reverse Osmosis is a filtering process which may be effective in areas that do not receive municipally treated water and is commonly used in bottled water facilities. The problem with this process is that dangerous chemicals like pesticides, herbicides, and chlorine are molecularly smaller than water and can pass freely through the filter. Reverse osmosis removes healthy, naturally occurring water minerals. These minerals not only provide good taste, they also serve a vital function in the body's system. When stripped of these minerals, water can be unhealthy. Also, 2-3 gallons of water are wasted for every gallon of purified water produced.</p>

            This Kangen water from this amazing medical device from Enagic has saved my life. It saved my career which is what I was afraid of loosing due to chronic pain and fatigue. I had planter fasciitis in both feet, arthritis in my neck, tennis elbow in both elbows, joint pain in my knees, psiatic nerve pain in both sides... Chronic back pain, etc etc etc... All gone now because of this amazing ionizer from Japan. My husband has no more gout pain in his feet and can eat red meat and drink beer without having a gout attack the way he used to after eating red meat and beer. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants relief from any degenerative disease or if the just want to be preventative and avoid these issues in the first place. I wouldn't buy any other machine out there. This is the one for me. I own 2!of them and my husband owns one. I'm going to buy the k8 soon so I can share with more friends and family!!! Enagic is the ONLY way to go.

It has helped me in other areas, I sleep better, no longer get sick or have colds, My joints are better and have no arthritis pain. I feel it helps me stay much healthier so as to prevent disease.

            I bought my Enagic Kangen Water ionizer in 2008. My husband's arthritis "magically disappeared" after just a few weeks of drinking it. In 7 years his arthritis has not returned. Nor have my allergies, my acid reflux or my skin issues.We have shared water with hundreds of people and have had many many such stories - some sounding too good to be true. I compared all brands of ionizers FOR HOURS... and months... to the ridiculous degree. I am a very thrifty person and I was NOT about to make a mistake on this very expensive investment. I called many companies and compared warranties. Enagic is the ONLY ionizer with a MANUFACTURER'S warranty. (A "Lifetime warranty means nothing from some distributor) They are also the only company whose system has the deep cleaning feature that ensures many more years of good quality ionized water. I would HIGHLY recommend an Enagic Kangen Ionizer system to anyone who cared about their health. 7 years later I am SO glad I made the right choice!

            I would like to highly endorse Enagic's superb products and high level of customer service. I have three of their ionizers which are EXCELLENT. One of the ionizers is over 5 years old and has had many thousand gallons passing through it, and it still works as well now as it did when I first purchased it. I have been working with the company for almost 6 years and at ALL times, I have received a high level of customer support, quality of technical support, and a friendly person to person caring and efficient response from their staff. Yes, they do get busy in their California office, and I would love them to increase the level of staffing for a slightly quicker response time, but one can always find the answer from other areas of support from one's local office and the Enagic distributorship. Excellent company to invest your time and energy into.
